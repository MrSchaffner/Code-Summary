# Market Indicator for The Goose Group

Separated out program into 
Node.js Server (Controller + Model) 
& 
Javscript Client (View + Controller).

Node.js server consumed Sockets and RESTful APIs. Data was stored on server and then hosted and sent to Client using websocket messages. 

Separation improved multithreading and sped up program considerably. 

Upgraded certain graphs away from Google Charts for speed and more aesthetic options.
