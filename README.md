# Code Summary

Unlike the other projects on GitHub, this repository only presents PART of a project. These summaries show actual code written for clients, demonstrating how I solved the problem, without revealing the entire structure of the project.

## Projects

### [Theatre Website App](url here)

A fully featured Website that I worked on for several Sprints (units of work). The site used ASP.NET with MVC (Model, View, Controller) to add and show rental details, and update them in the database.   The features I added included styling, creating CRUD (Create, Read, update, Delete) for parts of the site, and database management.

```bash
<script>
    alert("hello universe!");
</script>
```
